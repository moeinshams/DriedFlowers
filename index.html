    <div class="text"><h1>1. Dried flowers are long-lasting
        One of the biggest benefits of dried flowers is the fact that they last a really long time. Our process still guarantees us the best colouring and quality preservation. As you might know, dried flowers own their reputation to their durability, but also their 100% natural product identity. Dried flowers last an average of one year and when the dried flowers are dyed, they even last a couple of years. In compression: fresh flowers only last up to 10 days. So, with dried flowers you are able to create a long-lasting arrangement and bouquet.</h1></div>

        For the flower lovers that don’t feel like they can take care of real flowers, dried flowers are the way to go. Dried flowers are dried, which means they don’t need any water or taking care of in general.</h1></div>

    <div class="text"><h1>3. Dried flowers can be used for event decor
        Why would dried flowers be a ‘must’ for any event? Well, with fresh flowers, the decor has to be prepared on the same day because they will wither and eventually die. Because dried flowers have gone through a drying process, they will stay natural and will look beautiful throughout the whole event.</h1></div>
